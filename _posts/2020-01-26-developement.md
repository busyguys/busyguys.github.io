This post title has a long word that could potentially overflow the content area.

A few things to check for:

  * Non-breaking text in the title should have no adverse effects on layout or functionality.
  * Check the browser window / tab title.

The following CSS property will help you support non-breaking text.

```css
word-wrap: break-word;
```
